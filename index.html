                <p>Any device that is part of your network is an Endpoint.</p>
                <p>This covers PCs, tablets, cellphones, printers, and Internet of Things gadgets etc. Businesses used to estimate the number of endpoints based just on workstations and computers.</p>
                <p>However, with the popularity of smartphones and other mobile devices, classic PCs are no longer the majority of endpoints in most businesses.</p>
                <p>In Australia today, mobile devices account for over 50% of endpoints and handle a large amount of the workload. Endpoint security becomes essential as businesses adapt to a world where employees frequently work remotely from their homes.</p>
                <p>In 2021, 91% of IT workers believe that workstation security is just as critical as network security, according to a <a href="https://press.hp.com/content/dam/sites/garage-press/press/press-releases/2021/wolf-security-and-flexworker/2021_HP_Wolf_Security_Blurred_Lines_Report.pdf">Hewlett-Packard (HP) survey</a>. Risks are rising; in the past year, 54% of respondents reported seeing more phishing assaults.</p>
                <p>Additionally, almost half reported having seen printers with internet connections exploited as sources of attack.</p>
                <p>Due to their frequent online connectivity for real-time data retrieval, many of these businesses’ mission-critical machines are vulnerable to internet-based attacks.</p>
                <p>Now that the significance of these internet-based devices has been established, the question that arises is how a Melbourne business owner, such as yourself, could determine if their internet-facing devices are adequately secured.</p>

                <h4>Understanding the Cyber Threat Landscape for Melbourne Businesses</h4>

                <p>In the ever-evolving digital sphere, Melbourne businesses navigate a dynamic cyber threat landscape that demands heightened vigilance and strategic resilience.

                <p>The city’s expanding reputation as a tech hub attracts the attention of cybercriminals seeking new opportunities, placing even well-established businesses at risk.</p>
                <p>The evolving tech scene demands heightened vigilance and cybersecurity measures to safeguard the city’s dynamic innovation landscape. But despite all these, you need to have strategies to strengthen the cyber defence of your company. These may include:</p>

                <h5><b>1. Adhere to the Local Regulations</b></h5>
                <p>Effective cybersecurity extends beyond thwarting attacks; it involves adhering to standards and regulations safeguarding data and consumers.</p>
                <p>Melbourne businesses are required under the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme, to notify individuals and the Australian Information Commissioner of any severe data breaches. There are severe penalties for noncompliance.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, state-specific laws that are frequently disregarded require attention for legal compliance, particularly in the fields of healthcare, education, and finance.</p>
                <p>Knowledge of international cybersecurity legislation is essential for Melbourne businesses that operate internationally or store data overseas. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union highlights the necessity of a holistic approach to cyber protection by illustrating the worldwide ramifications of non-compliance.</p>
